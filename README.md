Welcome to the Udacity Neighbourhood Map Project
===================

About
-------------

This project was done while attending the Front End Developer course at [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com). In this project you will see a map of [Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg), the nicest city in Germany. ;-)

> **Notes for editing the project:**
> - You will need [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) for this project.
> - You will also need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
> - Once you have Compass and NodeJS installed run in your console/terminal:
> `npm install`

#### How to use the neighbourhood map

 1. Clone or download this repository
 2. Open the index.html in any browser (IE10 or greater)
 3. You can either click the markers or the list items to see more information about a certain Point of Interest
 4. Learn more about Hamburg
 5. Come to visit!

#### Information

There is currently only one break point set at screens smaller than 544px wide.

### TODOs (Ideas)
> - More options to filter and control the map
> - Create a Github hosted version of the project
> - Change the width of the info window
> - Add a JSON file to fetch TOP 50 places in Hamburg
> - Mix APIs (Foursquare, Yelp and TripAdvisor for example)

#### Frameworks, APIs used and disclaimer

For this project I used the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/), [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com).
As best as I could manage I did credits where credits are due. The Udacity forums served as a big information source, as well as Stackoverflow and numerous articles.
